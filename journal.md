#Abstract
This is a total waste of time but you will read it anyway...
# Title 

The academic wikipedia poem with citations

Acadamics say they hate wikipedia, 
yet they use it to steal all their media.
Using it to learn about their subject is something they do,
but then they tell you not to reference it to.

# A serious essay

So the previous section was just a stupid poem so... 
This one is more serious (supposidly)

We have demonstrated that this is clearly the best poem ever written 
In fact so good it is, those that read it may become light headed because of its power.
